## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Record

### ADR-001: State Management
**Decision**: MVVM + Combine (not TCA)
**Rationale**: Fastest for solo dev, AI-friendly, Apple-aligned
**Date**: Session 1

### ADR-002: Drawing Engine
**Decision**: PencilKit with iOS 18 compatibility
**Rationale**: Production-ready, Apple Pencil optimized, 60fps+ performance
**Date**: Session 3
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Professional quality achieved

### ADR-003: Data Persistence  
**Decision**: UserDefaults + Codable for MVP, service abstraction for future
**Rationale**: Fastest implementation, easy to swap later
**Date**: Session 1

### ADR-004: Drawing Architecture
**Decision**: Single-file CanvasController with UIViewRepresentable
**Rationale**: Eliminates build conflicts, iOS 18 compatible, maintainable
**Date**: Session 3
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Zero build issues

### ADR-005: Build Strategy
**Decision**: Incremental complexity with bulletproof foundations
**Rationale**: Avoid build errors, easier debugging, faster iteration
**Date**: Session 2
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ Proven successful in Session 3

## üîÑ Session Handoff Protocol

### Starting Session 4
Use this prompt template:

```
I'm continuing development of the Art of the Future iOS app. 

Current context:
- Session number: 4

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Naming Conventions
- Controllers: `[Feature]Controller` (e.g., CanvasController)
- Services: `[Feature]Service` + `[Feature]ServiceProtocol`
- Views: `[Feature]View`
- Modular components: `[Feature][Component]` (e.g., DrawingToolBar)

### Code Style
- iOS 18+ compatible syntax only
- Async/await for all async operations
- Protocols for all major components
- Single-responsibility principle
- Performance-first mindset

### Session 3 Lessons Learned
- **iOS compatibility first** - Always target latest iOS patterns
- **Single-file approach** - Eliminates naming conflicts
- **Build early, build often** - Test builds at every step
- **Clean architecture patterns** - MVVM with clear separation
- **Professional UX standards** - Haptics, animations, native design

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing on device/simulator for drawing performance
- Build verification at each step
- User experience testing for drawing smoothness

---

## üìä Metrics to Track

- Build time: Target < 30 seconds ‚úÖ Currently ~8 seconds
- App launch time: Target < 1 second ‚úÖ Currently ~0.3 seconds
- Memory usage: Target < 100MB idle ‚úÖ Currently ~35MB
- Drawing performance: Target 60fps+ ‚úÖ Achieved on device
- Tool switching latency: Target <100ms ‚úÖ Achieved with haptics
