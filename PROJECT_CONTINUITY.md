## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Record

### ADR-001: State Management
**Decision**: MVVM + Combine (not TCA)
**Rationale**: Fastest for solo dev, AI-friendly, Apple-aligned
**Date**: Session 1

### ADR-002: Drawing Engine
**Decision**: PencilKit now, Metal later via protocol abstraction
**Rationale**: Quick MVP, future flexibility
**Date**: Session 1
**Status**: Ready for implementation in Session 3

### ADR-003: Data Persistence  
**Decision**: UserDefaults + Codable for MVP, service abstraction for future
**Rationale**: Fastest implementation, easy to swap later
**Date**: Session 1

### ADR-004: Dependency Injection
**Decision**: SwiftUI Environment + lightweight Container
**Rationale**: No external dependencies, type-safe, simple
**Date**: Session 1
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ Simplified Container completed

### ADR-005: Build Strategy
**Decision**: Incremental complexity - working foundation first, then enhance
**Rationale**: Avoid build errors, easier debugging, faster iteration
**Date**: Session 2

## üîÑ Session Handoff Protocol

### Starting Session 3
Use this prompt template:

```
I'm continuing development of the Art of the Future iOS app. 

Current context:
- Session number: 3
- Last worked on: DrawingView foundation (working placeholder)
- Current branch: main
- Blockers: None - clean build ‚úÖ

Please review PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md and continue where we left off.
Next task: Implement PencilKit drawing canvas functionality

App is currently working with basic navigation and placeholder DrawingView.
Ready to add actual drawing functionality step by step.
```

### Ending a Session
Before ending, update these sections:
1. Current Project Status
2. Git commit with descriptive message
3. Any new Architecture Decisions
4. Known issues in Issues Log

---

## üìÅ Key Context Files

Always include these when starting a new session:
1. `PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md` (this file)
2. `ArtOfTheFutureApp.swift` (clean app structure)
3. `Container.swift` (simplified DI)
4. `Features/Drawing/DrawingView.swift` (current placeholder)
5. `MainTabView.swift` (tab navigation)

---

## üêõ Issues Log

### Known Issues
- None currently - clean build ‚úÖ

### Resolved Issues
- **Session 2**: Build errors from complex dependencies
- **Session 2**: Swift 6 concurrency issues with Container
- **Session 2**: Missing file references and circular dependencies

---

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Naming Conventions
- ViewModels: `[Feature]ViewModel`
- Services: `[Feature]Service` + `[Feature]ServiceProtocol`
- Views: `[Feature]View`
- Coordinators: `[Feature]Coordinator`

### Code Style
- Async/await for all async operations
- Protocols for all major components
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance tracking on critical paths

### Session 2 Lessons Learned
- **Start simple, enhance gradually** - Complex implementations cause build issues
- **Test builds frequently** - Use `Cmd+B` like `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Clean Container pattern** - Minimal DI first, expand as needed
- **File structure matters** - Proper Xcode project management essential

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for ViewModels and Services
- Snapshot tests for critical UI
- UI tests for main user flows

---

## üìä Metrics to Track

- Build time: Target < 30 seconds ‚úÖ Currently ~8 seconds
- App launch time: Target < 1 second ‚úÖ Currently ~0.3 seconds
- Memory usage: Target < 100MB idle ‚úÖ Currently ~35MB
- FPS during drawing: Target 120fps on iPad Pro (TBD Session 3)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Before Each TestFlight Build
- [ ] Increment build number
- [ ] Update PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Update release notes

### Before App Store Submission
- [ ] Complete all MVP features
- [ ] Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Add analytics events
- [ ] Implement error tracking
- [ ] Create App Store assets
- [ ] Write privacy policy
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
