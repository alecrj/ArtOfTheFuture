## 📋 CURRENT CHAT OBJECTIVES

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. Establish this progress tracking system
2. Define clear validation criteria
3. Set up git workflow for safety
4. Plan Chat 2 objectives

### Success Criteria for This Chat:
- ✅ Master progress tracker created
- ✅ Bulletproof plan established
- ✅ Clear rules and guidelines defined
- ✅ Next steps identified

## 🔍 VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Current Build Status:**
- ✅ App compiles successfully
- ✅ Basic tab navigation works
- ✅ Core features accessible
- ⚠️ Learning system needs complete rebuild

**Critical Files Status:**
- ✅ LessonModels.swift - Present but needs restructuring
- ✅ LessonsView.swift - Working but needs enhancement
- ✅ LessonsViewModel.swift - Functional but needs expansion
- ⚠️ Missing: Hierarchical content structure
- ⚠️ Missing: Progress tracking system
- ⚠️ Missing: Lesson player engine

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES & BLOCKERS
- None currently identified
- Previous 11 attempts failed due to rushing and lack of systematic approach
- Need to maintain strict incremental development

## 📅 NEXT CHAT PLAN

### Chat 2 Objectives:
1. Begin core learning engine implementation
2. Create hierarchical progress tracking system
3. Establish section/unit/lesson/step navigation
4. Validate basic structure works

### Chat 2 Success Criteria:
- New progress tracking models implemented
- Basic section navigation working
- Foundation for lesson player established
- All code compiles without errors

## 🔄 CONTINUITY NOTES

**Key Context for Next Chat:**
- We are building a Duolingo-style art learning app
- Target: 3 sections × 6-8 units × 5-10 lessons × 4-10 steps
- Current working commit has 5 basic lessons that need complete restructure
- Focus on foundation first, content scaling second
- Never break working state, always validate before proceeding

**Important Reminders:**
- Use project_knowledge_search for current codebase context
- Follow FAANG file management rules (no duplicates)
- Update this tracker every chat
- Commit working states to git

*Last Updated: Chat 1 - Foundation Planning Complete*
*Next Update: Chat 2 - Core Learning Engine Implementation*
🚨 NEW CHAT REQUIREMENTS
EVERY CHAT MUST START WITH:

Conflict Detection Search - Check for existing types
Service Interface Validation - Verify available methods
Dependency Mapping - Understand existing relationships
Incremental Plan - One change at a time

EVERY CHAT MUST END WITH:

Compilation Success - Zero errors required
Functionality Validation - Existing features work
Progress Tracker Update - Document exact status
Next Steps Definition - Specific incremental objectives

🎯 BULLETPROOF SAFEGUARDS
FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:

❌ Creating types with existing names
❌ Assuming service methods exist
❌ Batch file creation
❌ Competing hierarchies
❌ Breaking existing interfaces

REQUIRED ACTIONS:

✅ Search before creating
✅ Enhance instead of replace
✅ Test each change
✅ Preserve compatibility
✅ Document all changes

🔄 CONTINUITY NOTES - UPDATED
CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED:

Always search existing codebase first
Enhance existing models, don't create competing ones
Verify service interfaces before calling methods
One file change at a time, always
Compilation success is mandatory before proceeding
